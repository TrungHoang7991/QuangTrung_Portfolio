# QuangTrung_Portfolio

Hello everyone, thank you for visiting my Data Science portfolio. This is where I challenge myself with Data Science theoretical knowlegde such as : Statistic, Math, Machine Learning algorithm. Moreover, through out projects, I can upgrade my technical skills with Python and R programming languages. 

Hope we can learn from each other to be the better version.
