# QuangTrung_Portfolio

Hello everyone, thank you for visiting my Data Science portfolio. This is where I challenge myself with Data Science theoretical knowlegde such as : Statistic, Math, Machine Learning algorithms. Moreover, through projects, I can upgrade my technical skills with Python and R programming languages to get my dream job as a **Data Scientist**. 

I hope that, I can be a active user in Git community and we can learn new things from each other ! 

# [Project 1: IBM Data Science Certificate](https://github.com/TrungHoang7991/Coursera_Capstone/blob/main/San%20Jose%20Notebook.ipynb)
* Collecting data by scarping using Python libraries
* Analyzing the demographics of areas by Foursquare and Google Map API
* Clustering the 10th most common venue in each neighborhood

# [Project 2: Census Income Data](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1fHbDNAZEDRFP_JWu1DRYj1tv6SuO_mP0?usp=sharing)
* Exploratory data analysis with missing, unbalance dataset.
* Applying Classification and evaluation the accuracy of models.
* Applying Ensemble method to increase the accuracy of models.

# [Project 3: Credit Card Approval](https://github.com/TrungHoang7991/QuangTrung_Portfolio/blob/main/Credit%20Card%20Project/Credit%20Card%20Project.ipynb)
* Fill missing value for categorical and continous value with Imputer library.
* Applying 3 different Classification algorithms to calculate the accuracy of the model.
* Understanding how and when we need to standardize the values base on different type of algorithms.
* Beginning to learn about the bias-variance tradeoff of the model in tunning parameters.
